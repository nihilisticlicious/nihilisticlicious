## Currently
"Staring into the digital abyss, wondering if this code will even matter in the grand scheme of things. Currently entrenched in a {secrect project} — though who can say if the universe will even notice when it's done? Probably just another futile effort."

## About Me
A backend developer lost in the meaningless hum of servers and endless loops. I build things, not because they matter, but because they can be built. As I navigate the chaos of code and existence, I occasionally wonder if any of it will last longer than a few fleeting moments. But hey, if the universe is indifferent, at least my systems are scalable.

When I’m not programming, you’ll find me contemplating the void, listening to music that matches my existential mood, or reading things that remind me that, in the end, we’re all just stardust trying to make sense of an uncaring world. But I still code — because sometimes, the only thing that makes the meaningless feel bearable is solving a problem with elegance. Or maybe that's just another distraction from the inevitable.

## Contact
You can reach me at nihilisticlicious@emptiness.com. But let’s be real, it probably won’t change anything. If you need to talk about code or the meaning of life (or lack thereof), feel free to send a message. Maybe it’ll help, maybe it won’t. After all, nothing truly matters.
